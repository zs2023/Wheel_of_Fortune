# Wheel_of_Fortune

This is a learning project from Python 3 Programming Specialization from University of Michigan on Coursera. 
For full instructions, please refer to the course details page on Coursesa. 

In this project, I developed a game based on the popular TV game show "Wheel of Fortune" called "Wheel of Python." The task required me to demonstrate a strong understanding of Python, object-oriented programming (OOP), and use of JSON files. The game involved the creation of classes for a human player and a computer player, demonstrating the use of class inheritance and understanding of different subclasses.

Key tasks and responsibilities included:

Examining the provided code and JSON files to understand the existing game logic.
Implementing class definitions for human and computer players, focusing on their commonalities and differences.
Utilizing concepts of class definitions and inheritance to build upon the existing code structure.
Strategizing game logic for different subclasses to achieve different results with the same method names, displaying a deep understanding of class inheritance.
Ensuring user inputs for the human player resulted in appropriate game behavior, paralleling that of a computer character.
This project allowed me to showcase my ability to write clear, concise code, think strategically about class usage and inheritance, and apply a methodical approach to problem-solving. The end result was a fully functional game that could be played by both human and computer players.
